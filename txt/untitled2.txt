untitled2 

Immersed on a digital environment, ``untitled2'' lives on the limit between field recording and synthesis, music composition and sound art. This liminality aims to resonate its way into the complex difference between art and life.

It was composed and premiered during the ``Delian Academy for New Music'' held in Mikonos, Greece, in June 2018

Tech info:

This is a multichannel work for Laptop Performer. Depending on the number of available channels, the piece can be adapted from 4 to N channels. I have a 4 channel audio interface and a laptop to play the piece. However, if there is a house computer connected to a multichannel interface, the piece can be easily cloned from its github repository (github.com/fdch/untitled2), and can run on any OS because it is entirely made in Pure Data. Any questions, please contact me at fch226 [at] nyu [dot] edu.

If there is a house computer connected to a multichannel interface, I'd recommend using it instead of a laptop+interface situtation.
